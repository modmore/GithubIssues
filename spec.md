I'd like a snippet that fetches issues for a specified (private) repository on an organisation account, but only those that are marked with a specified tag and of course templateable with chunks. By default show all issues, but add a flag to only show issues that are still open.


Can be released as open source (with some sort of credit to modmore) after modmore launches.
